<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><b>Who are you?</b></p>
<p>A nobody trying to understand life and failing miserably. I am stuyding physics in Berlin. You can reach me through Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/QuentinWach">@QuentinWach</a>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><b>How do you learn?</b></p>
<p>It's very easy to forget what you have already achieved. I am mostly self-taught and I crave to create. When you build something during the learning process - even when it is very basic - it will show you later what you have accomplished already thus motivating you to improve further. Keep at it. Build momentum. In the end, you must not forget that movement creates motivation. Don't wait for devine inspiration. Don't follow your passion. If I had followed my passion, I'd be playing online games day and night. Follow what you think is an important mission. You will learn to love it as you see how you grow!</p>
<p>Also, the internet is your friend. But you will have to go to a library to get the right textbook. Learn by actively creating something, by applying what you learn and share it with everyone who will listen. - I will talk about this in full depth in the future.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><b>Why did you start this blog?</b></p>
<p>Well, teaching is a great way to learn. Blogging gives me the feeling that I am teaching something without having to depend on other people actually beeing there. And I desperatily want to prove myself to be usefull in any way as many ambitious people are in my age.</p>
