<h2>$\int_1^{\infty}$ What is Scientific Machine Learning? $\quad \;$</h2>
<p>
We may not simply apply machine learning techniques to physical problems but also apply our understanding of physics to inform our machine learning models and even ingrain them into the technique.

I want to be honest. I have only a vague understanding of machine learning,
my skills in mathematics are rudemantary at best and I am only studying physics
because it seemed like something that would challenge me and that it is.
Hence I am not qualified to research this topic. My goal is nonetheless to answer questions, to learn even when it is without rigor. I will try to do my best. This blog is somewhat of a diary, a documentation of this learning process, yet as I go over it, I will add and change the text so that I may have somewhat of a <b>coherent guide</b> instead of a set of rambeling notes.

When I was even younger than I am now, I wanted to understand the mechanics of thought. When I was painting I did not see it as much of a challenge. "It's not that hard to capture the appearance, the essence of something. Even a photograph can do it.", I thought. I didn't see why the people around me found it so faszinating to watch me paint. I didn't see what was interesting about it. It seemed quite straight forward to me. Why do they think different? After a while I realized, I had a very structured way of looking at the world and there were only
a few steps to follow, general rules by which anyone could learn to master painting and drawing. 
<b>Painting, like any other skill, is just a set of instructions.</b>

When I strictly follow a recepy to cook something, noone would regard this as a sign of high intelligence. I am merely following step by step instructions. I do  not improvise, I may not even learn from it. Because what is learning? If I ignored the recepy and simply reasoned how eggs and milk will mix to create a cake.
