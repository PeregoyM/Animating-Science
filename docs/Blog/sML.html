<h2>$\int_0^{\infty}$ What is this blog about? $\quad \;$</h2>
<p>
I want to be honest. I have only a vague understanding of machine learning,
my skills in mathematics are rudemantary at best and I am only studying physics
because it seemed like something that would challenge me and that it is.
Hence I am not qualified to research this topic. My goal is nonetheless to answer questions, to learn even when it is without rigor. I will try to do my best. This blog is somewhat of a diary, a documentation of this learning process, yet as I go over it, I will add and change the text so that I may have somewhat of a <b>coherent guide</b> instead of a set of rambeling notes.
</p>
<p>
With this web site I aim to provide a library of references and directions for everyone interested 
in applications of machine learning to the physical sciences and thinking about intelligence. 
</p>
<p>
My end goal will be to have published a good paper in the field. Watch me go!

<h2>Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning</h2>
<p>
<b>In the physical sciences Machine Learning (ML) has been widely adopted to analyze data and develop powerful prediction machines and classifiers.</b> Especially deep neural networks (DNNs) are being used increasingly as it seems to be a promising universal approximator. Yet, although their mechanics, their rules are clearly defined, their dynamics, especially during training, are poorly understood. Now researcher outside the the ML community are starting to find interest in learning approaches. Notably physicists are in desperate need of new techniques to model n-body problems e.g. in astrodynamics or quantum mechanics, as well as modelling biophysical systems.

300 years ago humans began to model the world using differential equations which allowed for precise, continous describtion and analysis. Computersimulations and numerical techniques then allowed us to approximate solutions and consider more nonlinear and discrete events. With
