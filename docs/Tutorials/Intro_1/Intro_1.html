<h1>HOW TO PLOT</h1>
<h2>INTRO I </h2>

<p>
This tutorial and all the following in this series are not oriented towards students just starting out and searching for coding advice or directions in how to set up their environment. - If however you already have some experince coding and using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and you want to start visualizing your data or simulation without moving to another tool, this is the guide you have been searching for. If not, let me convince you otherwise real quick:
</p>

<p><b>Why choose Python?</b>
- There are many great and easy programming languages and tools to create interactive visulatizations and animations for science most notably <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>. Yet Python is currently the most used programming language in STEM research mostly because it's very high level and therfore very easy to use. It offers a wide range of modules that can be imported to extent it's functionality and the community is working relentlessly to enable anyone to do anything with Python. You want to create and test new algorithms and design circuits for quantum computing? You want to prototype custom machine learning models as fast as possible? Anylze big data? Python is the way to go. - Even though the code might be intimidating for newcomers, you have complete control over every little aspect of your visualization and in contrast to Mathematica, it is also completely free!

<p><b>What do I need?</b> - Patience. Like anything else worth pursuing, learning to create nice science animations will take time. The main reason for me to write about this is, because I myself want to push myself forward. - You will have to install <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> for the basics. We will add more libraries as we move on.

<p>After you have installed Matplotlib you can immediatly start plotting. I recommend to install <a>Numpy</a> aswell if you dared not to do so in the past since it simplifies working with arrays immensily. We will plot a simple x-y-graph with the function</p>

<p>$$\; f(x) = (x-1)^3 + 1 + r(x)$$</p>

<p>with $r(x)$ beeing a random value that increases the further we are away from $P(x,y) = (1,1)$ with $-4 < x < 4$ and $-2 < y < 18$.
